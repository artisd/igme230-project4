    <h1>Alexei Tetenov's Project 4 page</h1>

    <p>I attempted 3 svg animations. My project proposal is linked <a href="igme230-project4-proposal.docx">here</a>.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><a href="photo.html">photo</a> - An svg camera that allows you to click on the smartphone volume button to display a picture. I was able to create the smartphone svg image in Adobe Illustrator and embedded it into my html. I tried using the Snap
            svg framework and I had a lot of issues.</li>
        <li><a href="floating_svg.html">floating_svg</a> - Svg images of my kids floating around in space. I tried using the Snap svg framework again but was not more successful. I used some straight svg animations</li>
        <li><a href="bicycle.html">bicycle</a> - An electric bicycle that had rolling wheels. I could not get the wheels to spin. I found a couple examples using the Snap svg on Stack Overflow and successfully modified the working examples in jsfiddle but
            could not get them working locally nor on the people.rit.edu site at <a href="rotating_circle.html">rotating_circle</a>.</li>
    </ol>
